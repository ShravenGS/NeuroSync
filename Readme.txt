There are 2 main circuits. Assembe all these in PCB rather tha using Breadboard which produces unusual noises when generates an output
Connect according to the circuit diagram 
For ESP32 use Arduino IDE on your Windows/Mac/Linux OS
For Raspberry Pi 4 install PiOS on your fresh SD Card and insert on your RPi4 for accessing.
After that run that robot.py script using Thonny PRogramming in PiOS on your RPi4

NOTE
I have tested this project using Proteus which works with only Arduino UNO. If Arduino UNO connection is working then we have proceeded withthe next procedure
